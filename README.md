# Initialize the phoneme generator
generator = TeluguPhonemeGenerator()

# Single-line Telugu text
single_line_text = "తెలుగు"  # Telugu script for 'Telugu'
phonemes_single_line = generator.generate_phonemes(single_line_text)

print("Telugu Text (Single Line):", single_line_text)
print("Phoneme Representation (Single Line):", phonemes_single_line)

# Multi-line Telugu text
multi_line_text = """
మిరుగు
విద్యా
తెలుగు
"""  # Telugu script spanning multiple lines

phonemes_multi_line = generator.generate_phonemes(multi_line_text)

print("Telugu Text (Multi-line):", multi_line_text)
print("Phoneme Representation (Multi-line):", phonemes_multi_line)
```

### Example Output
